## Gangopolis Frontend

**Overview of the Project:** 

> Gangopolis is an online multiplayer board game. There are three teams.
> Two gangster teams which compete for influence in the city and a
> police team which tries to stop the gangsters. The players take turns
> rolling the dice, moving and performing actions with the buildings in
> the game. The game ends when the police jails the gangsters or the
> gangsters gain control of the city.

It's made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). It communicates with the server through WebSockets ([SocketIO](https://socket.io/)). For styles I've used [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).  For various interactions, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [jQuery-UI](https://jqueryui.com/) have also been used. I was tasked with designing and implementing the front end of the game.
